		<div>Smart, creative, and deeply intuitive, Pisces can be close to psychic. Pisces feel things deeply, and have incredibly strong gut reactions. A Pisces "knows" things from deep within, and can often judge whether a person or situation is good or bad. That doesn't mean a Pisces ignores the logical part of their brain, though.</div>

		<h2 class="title t2">Cancer</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="text">
		<div>Emotional, intuitive, and practically psychic; ruled by the moon and characterized by the crab, Cancer has so much going on in its watery depths. Cancer loves connecting to a higher power, and may find comfort in religion or spiritual practices. And even though Crabs can be intense, they can adept wry humour pretty well.</div>

	</div>
	<div class="text">
		<div>Passionate, independent, and unafraid to blaze their own trail no matter what others think, Scorpios make a statement wherever they go. They love debates, aren't afraid of controversy, and won't back down from a debate. They also hate people who aren't genuine, and are all about being authenticâ€”even if authentic isn't pretty.</div>
